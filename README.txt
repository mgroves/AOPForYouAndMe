"AOP For You And Me"

Slides and Code

Notice the X_ReportService.cs files, where X is 1 to 7. Only the first one is included in the csproj. As I go through the code demos, I will exclude 1_ReportService.cs from the project and add 2_ReportService.cs to the project. And so on.

Also, I've included a "NotifyPropertyChanged" project. I don't normally include this in my presentations, unless I know it's a crowd where WPF/MVVM is of interest. I haven't updated this project to .NET 4.5 / latest PostSharp, but I may do so in the future.
